Finite differences

This directory contains code for solving the membrane equation using finite differences. This will be predominantly in C, but some MATLAB code may be included for validation purposes.

CURRENT STATUS: UNFINISHED

TO-DO:
* Complete C code for implicit and explicit solutions to the unforced membrane equation, in a format with compatible outputs
* Complete MATLAB code for solutions using in-built ODE solvers e.g. ode45
* Conduct validation of code against analytical solution to the unforced membrane equation, which will be a normal-modes type solution
* Make C code in a format compatible with Basilisk scripts
